ActiveRecord Off Rails
======================

Helping a friend use the outstanding ActiveRecord ORM outside of a Rails environment.

Might be useful for others, aswell.

Getting Started
---------------

 1. `bundle install`
 2. `ruby main.rb` for project root
 3. Play around with the `Model` class. It's ActiveRecord.
 4. Find a migration library that suits your needs. I will post examples for each in the future.
      1. [ActiveRecord Migrations](https://github.com/rosenfeld/active_record_migrations)
      2. [Standalone Migrations](https://github.com/thuss/standalone-migrations)
